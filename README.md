### The “Utilities” dataset includes information on 22 public utility companies in the US. The variable definitions are provided below.
### Fixed_charge = fixed-charge covering ratio (income/debt)
### RoR = rate of return on capital
### Cost = cost per kilowatt capacity in place
### Load_factor = annual load factor
### Demand_growth = peak kilowatthour demand growth from 1974 to 1975
### Sales = sales (kilowatthour use per year)
### Nuclear = percent nuclear
### Fuel_Cost = total fuel costs (cents per kilowatthour)
### 1. Compute the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation for each of the numeric variables using data.table package. Which variable(s) has the largest variability? Explain your answer.
### 2. Create boxplots for each of the numeric variables. Are there any extreme values for any of the variables? Which ones? Explain your answer.
### 3. Create a heatmap for the numeric variables. Discuss any interesting trend you see in this chart.
### 4. Run principal component analysis using unscaled numeric variables in the dataset. How do you interpret the results from this model?
### 5. Next, run principal component model after scaling the numeric variables. Did the results/interpretations change? How so? Explain your answers.
